<h1>My dearest grandmother,</h1>

<p>It has been so long since I have seen you. It is with regret that I admit that I have not kept up with you as I should have. Perhaps it is the distance, or perhaps the 65-year age gap.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, it is a mistake wholly on my own part.</p>

<p>I understand that your husband, my loving grandfather, has passed on. I must express my deepest condolences for your loss, and my regret that I did not take the many chances I had to get to know him better. My father tells the most fascinating stories about his adventures. I understand that he was never the same after returning from the war, but I still wish that I had taken the time to learn more about him as a person.</p>

<p>Can you believe that the last time I saw you, as a very small child, you were still teaching? Time makes fools of us all, it seems.</p>

<p>You never did share very much about your life as a third grade teacher. It seemed that you kept your personal and professional lives separate—a perfectly commendable action, though I think you may have, to put it lightly, taken this idea rather to the extreme. I always wished you might share an insight into your life as a teacher, and I&#39;m sure your students could have stood to hear a bit of a more personal story every now and then.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been keeping busy in Wisconsin. The weather is often miserable at best, and the labor situation here isn&#39;t what it used to be, but I&#39;ve gotten a job for a pretty large company, designing various automation processes and systems.</p>

<p>The most recent project has been a voting machine to use for top-level decisions. Since the high-ups can never agree on anything, management wanted me to design a &quot;majority vote&quot; machine to make decisions for them. Pretty typical of high-level management.</p>

<p>The machine is pretty simple, it just accepts a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; vote from the President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer. They cast their votes, then the machine decides the outcome, based on the majority&#39;s ruling, or the President&#39;s vote, if there&#39;s a tie.</p>

<p>Of course, I can&#39;t imagine you know much about Digital Electronics, having never used technology all your life. (I find myself acutely aware of this fact, due to, presently, my writing an actual physical letter to you.) Don&#39;t get me wrong—that&#39;s quite respectable, a feat nobody could even imagine nowadays. Let me explain using oversimplified, watered down metaphors.</p>

<p>Each part of the brain of the machine, the &quot;circuit,&quot; can essentially exist in one of two states at any time: either <em>on</em>, or <em>off</em>, not unlike how the lights in the classroom you taught in for sixty years can either be on or off. Just like numeric algebra, these states can be abstracted to a symbol, usually 0 for off and 1 for on. By combining these symbols, you can do a variation of algebra to them called boolean algebra—but I&#39;m getting ahead of myself.</p>

<p>The first step of creating the machine was to determine what I wanted the circuit to do. Since I had already received rather specific, well, specifications, I only had to create a truth table, which is essentially a list of every single possible combination of inputs (each board member&#39;s vote), and the output (decision) which that specific input would create. Every part of this process is expressed as a no/yes (0/1) signal inside the circuit, which transforms the four inputs into one final decision. Then, based on the truth table, we could create an extremely unsimplified logic expression of the circuit. As discussed previously, the logic expression is simply a symbolic abstraction of the actual function of the machine.</p>

<p>At this point it would probably make more sense to simplify the expression straightaway, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been required to do things inefficiently by your superiors as well. In any case, they wanted me to design the logic circuit based on the unsimplified expression, since it was apparently a <em>&quot;waste of my time&quot;</em> to bother about simplifying the expression.</p>

<p>AOI logic circuits are like lots of tubes connecting different &quot;gates.&quot; Each tube can, again, be either on or off. The gates have a number of different functions. Some, called &quot;inverters,&quot; take one tube in one end and have one tube out the other, and they always make the second tube the opposite of the first. So, if you send an inverter an &quot;on&quot; tube, it&#39;ll turn the output tube &quot;off,&quot; and vice versa. There&#39;s also an &quot;and&quot; gate, which takes two tubes in, and its output tube is always &quot;off&quot; unless <em>both</em> of its input tubes are in the &quot;on&quot; state. Last, there&#39;s an &quot;or&quot; gate, which also takes two tubes in, and its output tube is &quot;on&quot; if <em>either</em> of its two input tubes are &quot;on.&quot;</p>

<p>I used a computer program called &quot;Multisim&quot; to test the circuit without having to actually build it. You just draw it out on the screen, and it simulates it as if it were an actual physical circuit.</p>

<p>By combining these &quot;and,&quot; &quot;or,&quot; and &quot;inverter&quot; gates (hence &quot;AOI&quot;) you can create any of this type of logic circuit imaginable. You can imagine that with such a huge logic expression as I had, it took quite a few gates to create the circuit from the unsimplified logic expression. Using this, I managed to convince management that it would be better to build the <em>simplified</em> version of the circuit. Thank goodness!</p>

<p>The logic expressions aren&#39;t too difficult to simplify. You just use certain laws and theorems of boolean algebra (just like you use the laws and theorems of standard algebra) and make the expression as simple as possible, combining like terms, etc. I won&#39;t bore you with the specifics of the theorems, but just know that the logic expression was able to be made <em>considerably</em> simpler!</p>

<p>I used the same process to design and simulate the simplified circuit. Finally, after getting it approved, I built a functional, physical prototype on a device called a &quot;digital logic board.&quot; These boards allow you to test something out rapidly and easily without creating an actual printed circuit board or having to solder components together. You use metal wires for the &quot;tubes&quot; connecting the components, and these small chips that contain a few of each kind of &quot;gate&quot; that you need to use.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s off to the boys who will make it into a nice, shiny device for the board to use. Hopefully they&#39;ll be able to reach some agreements about things now.</p>

<p>I realize I&#39;ve gone on about myself far too long. Do tell me about any recent developments in your life.</p>

<p>Please write back.</p>
